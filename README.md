# Churn-Prediction-With-Feature-Engineering
This project is to use Feature Engineering for "Churn" Problems

## Explanation About the Problem/Request

TeCo wants from us to develop a machine learning model that can predict which customers  will leave the company, in other words who will be "Churn"

Before creating the model, the necessary data analysis and feature engineering processes will be carried out.

## Data Story

This dataset contains information about a fictional telecommunications company named TeCo, which provides home phone and internet services to 7043 customers in California. 
It indicates which customers have left the service, stayed, or signed up for the service.
